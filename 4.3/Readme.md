          KERNELS
================================

This repository contains the folders with the
kernel patchsets chosen and written to make the 
YaIniT kernel work the nearest possible to its designed functionality.

The patchsets for the standard kernel as downloadable from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org    and mirrors
are in the folders with main version name  ?.??

The patchsets for the GNU/Libre Kernel without all proprietary
firmware as downloadable from 
http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/     and     ftp://ftp.linux.org.tr 
are in the folders with the name libre-?.??-gnu

Also use the scripts deblob*  for generation of the GNU/Libre kernel.

ANNOTATIONS:
============

These published patches have all resulted in running kernels 
for machines of x86 architecture. 
Hopefully, one day, it will be possible to publish a similar unification
of different patchsets for the grand variety of RISC machines (ARM standards)
such that one kernel after 4.3.0 will suffice all developpers' needs
for all marketed machines .....

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2016
