Subject: ARM: dts: Kirkwood: Fix QNAP TS219 power-off
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/5442f0eadf2885453d5b2ed8c8592f32a3744f8e

The "reg" entry in the "poweroff" section of "kirkwood-ts219.dtsi"
addressed the wrong uart (0 = console). This patch changes the address
to select uart 1, which is the uart connected to the pic
microcontroller, which can switch the device off.
