This reverts commit eeecef0af5ea4efd763c9554cf2bd80fc4a0efd3.

Two users have reported an increased number of file system corruptions
after v3.6.2 (which had this patch backported).  The instances of
corruptions seem to be related to unclean shutdowns as the file system
was being unmounted or by the unexpected disconnection of external
disks.  So let's back out this change while do more investigation...
