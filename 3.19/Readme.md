          PATCHES FOR KERNEL 3.19
===============================================================

This repository contains the folders with the
kernel patchsets chosen and written to make the 
YaIniT kernel work the nearest possible to its designed functionality.

The patchsets for the standard kernel as downloadable from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org    and mirrors
are in the folders with main version name  ?.??

The patchsets for the GNU/Libre Kernel without all proprietary
firmware as downloadable from 
http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/     and     ftp://ftp.linux.org.tr 
are in the folders with the name libre-?.??-gnu

Also use the scripts deblob*  for generation of the GNU/Libre kernel.

ANNOTATIONS:
============

These published patches have all resulted in running kernels 
for machines of x86 architecture. 

Do not worry on unresolved rejects during the BusyBox patching. 
For my mainstream x86 hardware everything is working, but of
course you may eliminate the rejects.


Changes : 
====================================

Added updated patchset with latest Ubuntu commitments.....
