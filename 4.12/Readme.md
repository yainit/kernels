          PATCHES FOR KERNEL 4.12
==================================================

This repository contains the folders with the
kernel patchsets chosen and written to make the 
YaIniT kernel work the nearest possible to its designed functionality.

The patchsets for the standard kernel as downloadable from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org    and mirrors
are in the folders with main version name  ?.??

The patchsets for the GNU/Libre Kernel without all proprietary
firmware as downloadable from 
http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/     and     ftp://ftp.linux.org.tr 
are in the folders with the name libre-?.??-gnu

Also use the scripts deblob*  for generation of the GNU/Libre kernel.

ANNOTATIONS, CHANGES :
============================================

Unified patchsets for the 4.12,
are available over 4.12.11, composed to a running kernel, with extractions from Gentoo, ClearOS, 
Con Kolivas MuQSS, UKSM, BFQ, Ubuntu, OpenSuSE, Fedora, Mageia, PCLinuxOS, Puppylinux, YaIniT, 
in the file 'patches-Syltian-late-summer-surfs.tar.lrz'. 
I did get the long file warning of github, then I compressed it. I plan for future use to make a git branch for
the kernel for all those who want compare quickly. 

Caution : Due to the for now inedited Gentoo header patches for 4.12, these patches work over the linux-4.11 tarball!

#
The entire patchset of the loosely collected patches will follow later.
