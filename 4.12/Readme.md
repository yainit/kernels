==================================================

This repository contains the folders with the
kernel patchsets chosen and written to make the 
YaIniT kernel work the nearest possible to its designed functionality.

The patchsets for the standard kernel as downloadable from 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org    and mirrors
are in the folders with main version name  ?.??

firmware as downloadable from
