Subject: Input: ALPS - handle 0-pressure 1F events
References: bsc#987703
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-commit: a831776323e7c532ef9c88d0d62512ae15d78415
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dtor/input.git

While a button is held SS5 hardware will give us single-finger packets
with x, y, and pressure equal to zero. This causes annoying jumps in
pointer position if a touch is released while the button is held. Handle
this by claiming zero contacts to ensure that no position events are
provided to the user.
