Subject: Default value of usbhid.pb_fnmode module parameter
From: olh@suse.de

 The kernel default value for usbhid.pb_fnmode is 1, which means that pressing
 the Fn keys (F1..F10) without the fn key triggers the special functions
 decrease/increase brightness, mute, decrease/increase volume, etc., which is
 the default under MacOS.

 At least under 10.2 Beta2, only the volume related special functions work at
 all. In addition, Ctrl-Alt-Fx is used to switch between consoles. with
 pb_fnmode==1, the fn key needs to be pressed in addition.

 Therefore, pb_fnmode==2 (F1..F10 by default trigger Fn rather than the special
 functions) makes more sense under Linux.
