Subject: [PATCH] firmware: Allow release-specific firmware dir
Patch-mainline: not yet

 Every kernel package trying to provide files under /lib/firmware runs
 into problems really quickly with multiple kernels installed.

 This patch moves them to /lib/firmware/$KERNELRELEASE. udev v127's
 firmware.sh looks there first before falling back to /lib/firmware.
